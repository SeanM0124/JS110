//Each UUID consists of 32 hexadecimal characters
//(the digits 0-9 and the letters a-f)
//represented as a string. The value is typically broken into 5 sections
//in an 8-4-4-4-12 pattern, e.g., 'f65c57f6-a6aa-17a8-faa1-a67f2dc9fa91'.

//Write a function that takes no arguments
//and returns a string that contains a UUID.
